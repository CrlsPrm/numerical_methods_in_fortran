    ! Variable declarations
    ! Depending on the PDE and solution method, you may need:
    ! - Discretization parameters (grid/mesh size, time steps, etc.)
    ! - Boundary and initial conditions
    ! - Arrays or matrices for storing solutions

    ! Example variables (customize as needed)
    real, allocatable :: grid(:,:), solution(:,:)
    integer :: grid_size, time_steps

    ! Initialize variables
    grid_size = 100   ! Example grid size (adjust as needed)
    time_steps = 50   ! Example number of time steps (for time-dependent PDEs)

    ! Allocate and initialize the grid and solution array
    allocate(grid(grid_size, grid_size))
    allocate(solution(grid_size, grid_size))
    grid = 0.0        ! Initialize grid (customize as needed)
    solution = 0.0    ! Initialize solution array

    ! Set boundary and initial conditions (as required by your PDE)

    ! Call the PDE solution methods from the module
    ! Note: These calls are placeholders; you'll need to pass appropriate arguments
    ! based on the specific PDE and method requirements.

    ! Finite Difference Method
    call finite_difference(grid, boundary_conditions, solution)

    ! Finite Element Method
    ! call finite_element(mesh, boundary_conditions, solution)

    ! Crank-Nicolson Method (for time-dependent PDEs)
    ! call crank_nicolson(grid, time_steps, boundary_conditions, initial_conditions, solution)

    ! Post-processing
    ! - Analyze the solution
    ! - Write the solution to files for visualization

    ! Clean up
    deallocate(grid, solution)
