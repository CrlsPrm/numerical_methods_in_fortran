# numerical_methods_in_fortran
Codes written based on classes from my computational physics course 1 and own research.

Programs made in the VSCode code editor and compiled in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with the terminal commands "gfortran -c namefile.f90" and to create executables with modular programs "gfortran main.o module1.o -o executablename.out" of course of their respective individual compilation, finally the program is executed in terminal with " ./executablename.out ".
