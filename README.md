# Fortran Numerical Methods

[![Language: English](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-English-blue)](./README.md) [![Language: Español](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Espa%C3%B1ol-green)](./README.es.md)

Welcome to our repository dedicated to the implementations of various numerical methods using the Fortran programming language. We offer a wide range of methods that can be utilized in many fields of study, from solving ordinary differential equations, numerical interpolation, to finding roots of equations, and much more. 

## Repository Structure

-   `data`: This directory stores data files that serve as input for our demonstration programs.
-   `modules`: This directory contains Fortran modules for distinct numerical methods.
-   `outputs`: This directory is used for storing output files generated by our demonstration programs.
-   `trash`: This is a temporary holding directory for ephemeral files and files that are currently in the process of organization.

## Featured Programs and Method Implementations

Below is a list of our main programs and the numerical methods they implement. Each table entry indicates the current implementation status. We continue to work on this repository and expect to complete unfinished methods soon.

## Compilation and Execution Instructions

Follow these steps to compile and run any of the main programs:

1.  Navigate to the repository root directory.
    
2.  Compile the desired main program using `gfortran`. For instance, to compile `main_derivative.f90`, run:
    
```bash
    gfortran modules/edo_solution.f90 main_edo.f90 -o main_edo.out 
```
3.  Run the compiled program. For example, to execute `main_derivative.out`, run:
```bash
    ./main_edo.out 

```
