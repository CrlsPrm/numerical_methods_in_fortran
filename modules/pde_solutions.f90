! Program: Partial Differential Equations (PDE) Solver
! Author: Carlos Raul
! Description: This module offers a suite of numerical methods for solving
!              various types of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), including
!              elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDEs. It features the Finite
!              Difference Method for spatial discretization, the Finite Element
!              Method for handling complex geometries and boundary conditions,
!              and the Crank-Nicolson Method for time-dependent problems with
!              improved stability and accuracy. The module is designed to be
!              flexible and applicable to a wide range of PDE problems in fields
!              such as physics, engineering, and applied mathematics. Solutions
!              can be exported for analysis and visualization.
